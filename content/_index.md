description: Welcome! I’m a computational scientist and I work at the intersection of deep learning, chemistry/physics, and large scale computing. One common thread across my research has been a focus on sustainable energy conversion and storage. If you are interested in my current or past work check out the projects link. Additionally, I occasionally write blogs so check those out as well — moving forward I hope I will be able to write more. If you would like to get in touch you can reach me at [bmwood at fb dot com].
